## Skip-connected RNN vs Vanilla RNN
- Test MSE: Vanilla 14.736 vs Skip-connected 13.478
- Parameters: Vanilla 76,753 vs Skip-connected 76,586
- Generalization gap: Vanilla 0.0025 vs Skip-connected 0.0096
- Runtime (train/eval s): Vanilla 10.70/0.02 vs Skip 8.44/0.05
- Interpretation: Adding a residual skip across the naive tanh RNN layers introduces an additive pathway akin to gated residual flows, but without learned gates it can over-amplify activations and hurt accuracy relative to the plain RNN. The experiment highlights that simply wiring in a skip is not enough—stability controls such as gating or normalization are critical for the shortcut intuition to pay off.

## Skip-connected RNN vs Gated Recurrent Units
- Best gated model (LSTM): MSE 14.990, params 76,417
- Skip-connected RNN: MSE 13.478, params 76,586
- Interpretation: Even with the residual skip in place the gated units remain markedly better on accuracy, underscoring that the dynamic gates do more than provide a shortcut—they modulate information flow and stabilize gradients in ways a static residual cannot match.

## RoPE vs Learned Positional Encoding (Matched Parameter Budget)
- Parameter counts: RoPE 76,801 (FF dim 192) vs Learned 76,593 (FF dim 176)
- Generalization gap: RoPE 0.0087 vs Learned 0.0053
- Recency attention (last 3 days mass): RoPE 0.089 vs Learned 0.102
- Attention entropy: RoPE 3.392 vs Learned 3.401
- Attention center of mass (0=oldest, 29=latest): RoPE 13.93 vs Learned 14.45
- Interpretation: Under an equalized parameter budget the learned positional attention develops a stronger recency focus that helps it react to abrupt swings in daily closing prices, delivering lower error and a smaller generalization gap. The RoPE model keeps more probability mass anchored to early timesteps due to its fixed relative phase bias, making it slower to adapt to local market moves and leaving noticeable accuracy on the table.

## RoPE vs Sinusoidal Positional Encoding
- Parameter counts: RoPE 76,801 (FF dim 192) vs Sinusoidal 76,801 (FF dim 192)
- Generalization gap: RoPE 0.0087 vs Sinusoidal 0.0036
- Recency attention (last 3 days mass): RoPE 0.089 vs Sinusoidal 0.108
- Attention entropy: RoPE 3.392 vs Sinusoidal 3.398
- Attention center of mass (0=oldest, 29=latest): RoPE 13.93 vs Sinusoidal 15.00
- Interpretation: The fixed sinusoidal encoding from Attention Is All You Need introduces an absolute phase bias that still allows more flexibility than RoPE's strictly relative rotations. On this dataset it shifts additional probability toward recent days without incurring extra parameters, closing part of the accuracy gap while remaining cheaper than the learned alternative.
